\arguments{
\item{r}{To-be-corrected correlation coefficient.}

\item{ntests}{An integer indicating how many times larger the full test is, 
for which the corrected correlation coefficient is being computed.}
}
\value{
Spearman-Brown corrected correlation coefficients.
}
\description{
Spearman-Brown correction
Perform a Spearman-Brown correction on the provided correlation score.
}
\details{
When \code{ntests=2}, the formula will compute what the correlation coefficient would be 
if the test were twice as long.
